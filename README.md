Overview & Contents

This repository contains the code and (links to) the data used to produce the results for [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372621568_Can_We_Protect_Time_Series_Data_While_Maintaining_Accurate_Forecasts).

`Code` contains all code files in two subdirectories (1) `Analysis`, which contains all files used to produce the results in the paper, and (2) `Exploratory`, which contains old code files no longer relevant to the project. The `Code-Directions.txt` file contains directions for running the code which we have also written below.
