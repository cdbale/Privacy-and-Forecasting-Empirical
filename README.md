This repository contains the code and (links to) the data used to produce the results for [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372621568_Can_We_Protect_Time_Series_Data_While_Maintaining_Accurate_Forecasts). General repository structure is as follows:

* `Code`: contains all code files in two subdirectories, `Analysis`, which contains all files used to produce the results in the paper, and `Exploratory`, which contains old code files no longer relevant to the project. The `Code-Directions.txt` file contains directions for running the code which we have also written below.



This package includes code files written in both Python and R, so make sure you have both installed. We used the following versions:

Python (Anaconda Distribution):
