in privacy analysis - be sure to undo code where the first column of k-nts protected data is removed

re-run k-nTS because row indices got left in there.

re-run all forecasting code.

check code for any errors - make sure the test files are correct?

check the features that were selected for each model - if they were very different, this could produce sub-optimal results if we averaged
across models.

Condition all utility and feature measurements on the privacy levels. Compare methods with similar privacy levels!




RESULTS:

file with average results for each privacy method across all time series/models

file(s) with average results across all models for each data set

file(s) with average results across all data sets for each model

file(s) with average results for each model on each data set

Do everything in percentage increases???






# computation time feature extraction

# computation time knts and knts+

# need computation time code for all models

# FOR H1: need to save VAR weights and simulate series

TO DO FOR CODE

- run for all M3 data
- create scripts that are completely contained, and then
you run the forecasting analysis from the command line by specifying
the desired parameters.
- clean up library imports
- set a random seed wherever appropriate
- implement an option to use random or correlation weighted sampling
- reduce the amount of things that are saved to just the essentials for the paper

- go through code and make sure everything is well commented
