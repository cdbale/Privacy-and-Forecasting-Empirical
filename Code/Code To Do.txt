# computation time feature extraction

# computation time knts and knts+

# need computation time code for all models

# FOR H1: need to save VAR weights and simulate series

TO DO FOR CODE

- run for all M3 data
- create scripts that are completely contained, and then
you run the forecasting analysis from the command line by specifying
the desired parameters.
- clean up library imports
- set a random seed wherever appropriate
- implement an option to use random or correlation weighted sampling
- reduce the amount of things that are saved to just the essentials for the paper

- go through code and make sure everything is well commented
