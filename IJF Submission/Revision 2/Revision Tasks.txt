Revision Tasks



- note that we are skipping the VAR inverse forecasts for DP_0.1 on the original data due to infinite values

- feels like an excessive number of subsections in the empirical section. What do coauthors think?


- make sure all section references throughout the document are correct
- make sure all figure and table references throughout the document are correct

- Sections 5.2 and 5.7 are both about time series features - merge these sections
- add description of cross-series correlation features



- next steps: include correlation features in k-nTS+ on the M3 data, M3-rate data, and so on


- redo plots
	- make changes suggested by reviewers
	- Figures 1, 6, and 8: put both figures into the same plot with different point types and colors
- Address the fact that the s parameter in tables 8 and 9 is not the same - make it the same?

- go through reviewer document and add responses to questions/comments
- address reviewer comment about series with large magnitude dominating the change in MAE. Does our calculation account for this? 
	What is the mean change in accuracy at the series level?
	Can we calculate and compare the percentage change in a trimmed mean? (both of these points may be addressed by calculating the AvgRelMAE as done by Fildes)
- focus on computation time of the k-nTS+ process only (omit computation time from forecasting models)
- address incorporation/consideration of multivariate time series features
	Talked about comparing the before/after cross-series correlation matrices - what is the average absolute difference in correlations
- proof read entire paper
